Thanks for contributing to react-transmission!

Here is a short checklist of additional things to keep in mind before submitting:
* Please make sure your pull request description makes it very clear what you're trying to accomplish. If it's a bug fix, please also provide a failing test case (if possible). In either case, please add additional unit test coverage for your changes. :)
* Run tests locally (`yarn test`) to ensure that your change did not break linting or functionality.
